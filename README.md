ABCDI: Automated BOT for Covid test results Data entry into ICMR portal

ABCDI is an desktop bot for automatic entry of COVID RTPCR test results into ICMR portal, https://cvstatus.icmr.gov.in, which is mandatory for COVID tests done in India as per Government of India and State Government orders. 

The bot runs locally from the desktop computer, without sharing data elsewhere apart from the ICMR covid portal. 
Instructions for use:
Typically, the data of samples is received along with samples or generated from NIC's SRF app, which is filled during sample collection.
The collated information should be then updated after the samples are processed and tested for RT-PCR.
An excel sheet of the data should be prepared in the format as in "example data feed.xlsx".
Update the "logins.xlsx" file with login credentials of the lab.
